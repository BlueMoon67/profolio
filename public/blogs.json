It\u2019s kind of charming, honestly. When he talks, the world seems to pause. He\u2019s backed by strong academics and is one of the most desirable guys in college. Despite his popularity, he\u2019s kind, avoids useless conversations, and stays focused on his dreams.<br>He has a few close friends, but the most special among them is Sonu\u200a\u2014\u200aa tall, thin girl with round spectacles. Unlike Anurag, Sonu loves being around people. To spend more time with her, Anurag often hangs out with her friends, leaving us behind. It makes me wonder: why do boys change when they find someone attractive.<br>As usual, Neel, Ranjan, and I were roaming around when Anurag rushed up, breathless.<br>\u201cWhat happened? Control your breath!\u201d<br>\u201cNothing,\u201d he said. \u201cI need 500 bucks. Right now. Cash.\u201d<br>We searched our pockets and, like always, were out of money. Inflation worries me a lot\u200a\u2014\u200ait\u2019s so hard to save anything in this country. While Neel and I joked about our empty wallets, Ranjan handed Anurag the money. He darted off. Suspicious, we decided that Detective Holmes must investigate.<br>Mission Activated. Skip Class. Trail Begins.<br>He moved between shops across NIT Market. It\u2019s not huge, but it\u2019s packed with local stores and great food. We were too focused on our mission to eat. Then he hopped on an auto to Gandhi Maidan, and from there to City Mall. The journey cost us \u20b940 each\u200a\u2014\u200a\u20b9120 gone just for tailing.<br>He stopped near the mall where we saw Sonu\u2019s friends. We assumed they were going to watch a movie. We didn\u2019t disturb them; besides, City Mall has other pretty girls to gaze at\u200a\u2014\u200amaybe luck would bless us with a phone number. Sounds simple? It\u2019s one of the hardest things to pull off.<br>Anurag moved ahead, and we wandered. Suddenly I remembered a book I\u2019d wanted for a long time: The Kite Runner. It was always sold out or unavailable. I headed to Crossword to buy it but froze when I saw Sonu\u2019s group speaking to the store owner. I didn\u2019t want to interrupt.<br>After a short talk, they handed over a gift and a letter. I didn\u2019t understand it.

It\u2019s kind of charming, honestly. When he talks, the world seems to pause. He\u2019s backed by strong academics and is one of the most desirable guys in college. Despite his popularity, he\u2019s kind, avoids useless conversations, and stays focused on his dreams.<br>He has a few close friends, but the most special among them is Sonu\u200a\u2014\u200aa tall, thin girl with round spectacles. Unlike Anurag, Sonu loves being around people. To spend more time with her, Anurag often hangs out with her friends, leaving us behind. It makes me wonder: why do boys change when they find someone attractive.<br>As usual, Neel, Ranjan, and I were roaming around when Anurag rushed up, breathless.<br>\u201cWhat happened? Control your breath!\u201d<br>\u201cNothing,\u201d he said. \u201cI need 500 bucks. Right now. Cash.\u201d<br>We searched our pockets and, like always, were out of money. Inflation worries me a lot\u200a\u2014\u200ait\u2019s so hard to save anything in this country. While Neel and I joked about our empty wallets, Ranjan handed Anurag the money. He darted off. Suspicious, we decided that Detective Holmes must investigate.<br>Mission Activated. Skip Class. Trail Begins.<br>He moved between shops across NIT Market. It\u2019s not huge, but it\u2019s packed with local stores and great food. We were too focused on our mission to eat. Then he hopped on an auto to Gandhi Maidan, and from there to City Mall. The journey cost us \u20b940 each\u200a\u2014\u200a\u20b9120 gone just for tailing.<br>He stopped near the mall where we saw Sonu\u2019s friends. We assumed they were going to watch a movie. We didn\u2019t disturb them; besides, City Mall has other pretty girls to gaze at\u200a\u2014\u200amaybe luck would bless us with a phone number. Sounds simple? It\u2019s one of the hardest things to pull off.<br>Anurag moved ahead, and we wandered. Suddenly I remembered a book I\u2019d wanted for a long time: The Kite Runner. It was always sold out or unavailable. I headed to Crossword to buy it but froze when I saw Sonu\u2019s group speaking to the store owner. I didn\u2019t want to interrupt.<br>After a short talk, they handed over a gift and a letter. I didn\u2019t understand it.
